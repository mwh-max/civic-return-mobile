## Status: Prototype (Frozen)

This project was an early prototype exploring public assets per capita in Kentucky.  
It is published here as-is and is no longer being actively developed.

The code and results reflect the state of the experiment at the time of release.  
Future iterations may take a different direction or build on different data sources.
